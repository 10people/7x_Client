How to use:
- Simply add the ParticleScaler script to a particle, and change the scale value exposed by the script.
- The Particle Scaler also works on entire particle systems with multiple emitters in the children. In this case, just apply the ParticleScaler script to the root object of the particle.

Note that if you drag the value up and down too much, some floating point imprecision might occur. 
This means for example that a number that was 15 will now be 14.9999999. This will not have any impact on the way the particle looks.

Because the particle scaler uses some editor functionality, you will only be able to scale the particles within the editor. You cannot adjust the scale in real-time in an exported build.

Sometimes the particles get cut off, this is because of a bug in Unity itself. These particles can still be scaled, but only without the 'Also scale GameObject' enabled.
